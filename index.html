<h1> &#60;audio&#62;: A History of Digital Sounds </h1> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
New technologies did not come to exist in a vacuum; they instead come from a lineage of many technologies from the past. Haas (1999) speaks of the importance of complicating existing, overly simplistic ideas that people have about technological progress. One common idea is that of <i>simple replacement</i>, “which assumes that old and new technologies are clearly differentiated from each other, both theoretically and in practice, and that new technologies simply replace older, obsolete technologies” (p.210). However, many technologies complement each other and can even be used alongside each other. This is true with music-- for example, the use of CDs in a car, and MP3s on a computer. The second simplistic idea is that of <i>strightforward progress</i>, which is the idea that new technologies are inherently better than old technologies. While improvements can be made, it is important to think critically about these changes. Sometimes, when you gain something, you lose something else. </p>
    
<h2>Digital Sound Before HTML</h2>
    <p> Sound has been recorded since the first record of recorded music notes in <i>year</i>. However, the first true reproduction of sound was Thomas Edison's phonograph in 1877, which involved speaking into a mouthpiece, the sound of which vibrated a stylus accross tinfoil to create a crude recording &#40;Beardsley & Leetch-Wilkinson&#41;. </p>
    

    
<h2>The History of &#60;audio&#62; Element</h2>
<p> HTML stands for <u>H</u>yper<u>T</u>ext <u>M</u>arkup <u>L</u>anguage, which a common language (?) used in the creation of websites. HTML uses elements, which are sometimes referred to as tags, in order to describe and style content on a web page. This website will focus on the history of the &#60;audio&#62; element, which is used to add sounds to websites.  </p>
<p> The &#60;audio&#62; element was added in HTML5. Before that, websites needed to use plugins such as Flash and Silverlight to display audio or video content on websites. However, these had problems with security and did not always work well with HTML and CSS elements. Therefore, the native HTML audio element was added in HTML5 to overcome these issues (4).</p>

    
<h2>Syntax and Attributes</h2>
    
<p>Here is some example code with the &#60;audio&#62; element, based on the example code from the Mozilla Developers website:</p>
    
<code>
    &#60;audio controls&#62;
  &#60;source src="flexidrum.wav" type="audio/wav" autoplay="true" loop="true"&#62;
Your browser does not support the HTML5 audio element. Here is a &#60;a href="flexidrum.wav"&#62;link to the audio&#60;/a&#62; instead.
&#60;/audio&#62;
</code>
    
<br>

<h3>Attributes</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>controls:</dt> <dd>This uses the browser's default audio control interfact. You can also build your own interface using JavaScript. Minimum requirements for custom controls are the ability to start, stop, and adjust the volume.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>src:</dt> <dd>The source attribute contains a path to the audio you wish to embed.</dd>
        <dt>type:</dt> <dd>descrives the file format</dd> 
        <br>
        <dt>fallback content:</dt> <dd>The paragraph inside the audio tags will display if the browser is older and cannot display the &#60;audio&#62; element.</dd>
    
    </dl>



<h2>Basic Audio Formats</h2>
    <i>Describe the basics of different audio formats here; perhaps discuss codecs...</i>
<dl>
<dt>.MP3</dt><dd></dd>
<dt>.WAV</dt><dd></dd>
<dt>.OGG</dt><dd></dd>
<dt>Etc....</dt><dd></dd>

</dl>
    
<h2> Sample Audio </h2>
<p>This audio player uses the default settings from your browser:</p>
<audio controls>
  <source src="flexidrum.wav" type="audio/wav" loop="true">
Your browser does not support the HTML5 audio element. Here is a <a href="flexidrum.wav">link to the audio</a> instead.
</audio>
<aside>
<p><i>Free sounds available from freeound.org</i></p>
</aside>
    <p><i>Maybe include a fancy Javascript media player example here...</i></p>
    
<h2>Analysis and Conclusions</h2>
<p>Is the audio element an improvement on past technologies? This depends on the context. Digital audio players offer a great deal of convienience to people using devices with internet access such as laptops, tablets, and phones. When the content is downloaded, it can be played from anywhere with enough battery power. However, the audio tag itself involves streaming content from online; therefore, it's only viable if you have an internet connection. Written music is still the standard for much of music education &ite?) since it provides the needed information without the distractions inherent in a device connected to the internet. In addition, older media formats such as CD-ROMs may be more convienient when riding in older cars.</p>
