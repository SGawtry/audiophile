<h1> &#60;audio&#62;phile </script>: A History of Digital Sounds </h1> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
New technologies did not come to exist in a vacuum; they instead come from a lineage of many technologies from the past. Haas (1999) speaks of the importance of complicating existing, overly simplistic ideas that people have about technological progress. One common idea is that of <i>simple replacement</i>, “which assumes that old and new technologies are clearly differentiated from each other, both theoretically and in practice, and that new technologies simply replace older, obsolete technologies” (p.210). However, many technologies complement each other and can even be used alongside each other. This is true with music-- for example, the use of CDs in a car, and MP3s on a computer. The second simplistic idea is that of <i>strightforward progress</i>, which is the idea that new technologies are inherently better than old technologies. While improvements can be made, it is important to think critically about these changes. Sometimes, when you gain something, you lose something else. </p>

<h2>The History of audio Element</h2>
<p> HTML stands for <u>H</u>yper<u>T</u>ext <u>M</u>arkup <u>L</u>anguage, which a common language (?) used in the creation of websites. HTML uses elements, which are sometimes referred to as tags, in order to describe and style content on a web page. This website will focus on the history of the audio element, which is used to add sounds to websites.  </p>
<p> The audio element was added in HTML5. Before that, websites needed to use plugins such as flash to display audio or video content on websites.</p>
