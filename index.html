<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
New technologies did not come to exist in a vacuum; they instead come from a lineage of related technologies from the past. Haas (1999) speaks of the importance of complicating existing, overly simplistic ideas that people have about technological progress. 
    
<p> One common idea is that of <i>simple replacement</i>, “which assumes that old and new technologies are clearly differentiated from each other, both theoretically and in practice, and that new technologies simply replace older, obsolete technologies” (p.210). However, many technologies complement each other and can even be used alongside each other. This is true with audio-- for example, the use of CDs in a car, written music books in front of a piano, and MP3s on a laptop. </p>

<p> The second simplistic idea is that of <i>straightforward progress</i>, which is the idea that new technologies are inherently better than old technologies. While improvements can be made, it is important to think critically about these changes. Sometimes, when a technology has a new benefit, it is at the expense of something else. </p>

<h2>Audio Before (and Alongside) the Internet</h2>
    
    <img src="images/betterCollage.png" alt="Collage of music players">
    
    <p> Music has been written since at least 800 BCE, when the first known music notation was found on a cuneform tablet (Hollis, 2017). The creation of music players outside of the internet is breifly annotated below.
        
    
    <ul><b>1877: The Phonograph</b><br> The first instrument able to record and reproduce sound was Thomas Edison's phonograph. The user would speak into a mouthpiece, the sound of which vibrated a stylus accross a moving span of tinfoil to create a crude recording. &#40;Beardsley & Leetch-Wilkinson&#41;</ul>
    
    <ul><b>1887: The Gramophone</b> Emile Berliner's gramophone greatly improved upon the quality of sound in the phonograph. It was the first device to play a record music disc. In 1896, it went on the market as the Victrola player.</ul>
    
    <ul><b>1983: First Wireless Radio Demo</b> Nicolai Tesla successfuly demonstrated a wireless radio player. Guglielmo Marconi also developed a wireless radio around this time. At first, it was primarily used to communicate with ships at sea. The radio did not become popular in US homes until around the 1920s. </ul>
    
     <ul><b>1954: The Transistor Radio</b> This invention made the radio portable, so that users could carry music with them. </ul>
    
     <ul><b>1954: The Cassette Tape</b> Cassette tapes were even smaller than the records available on the portable stereo. These allowed users to create mixtapes for the first time. The player became portable with The Sony Walkman in 1979.</ul>
    
     <ul><b>1954: The First CD-ROM</b> CR-ROMs had a higher quality than cassette tapes and were more durable.</ul>
    
    <ul><b>1998: The First MP3 Player</b> This player allowed users to play music files directly in a compact, portable way. The popular IPod was released in 2001.</ul>
    
    <p> Which phone constitutes the first modern smartphone is debatable. Regardless of the exact year and model, it is clear that listening to music on cell phone devices is very popular in the modern age. That usage often intersects with the internet, for example listening to music on YouTube. Now we will discuss the history of audio in relation to internet streaming and HTML. </p>
    


    
<h2>The History of &#60;audio&#62; Element</h2>
<p> HTML stands for <u>H</u>yper<u>T</u>ext <u>M</u>arkup <u>L</u>anguage, which a common programming language for the creation of websites. HTML uses elements, which are sometimes referred to as tags, in order to describe and style content on a web page. This website will focus on the history of the &#60;audio&#62; element, which is used to add audio content to websites.  </p>
<p> The &#60;audio&#62; element was added in HTML5. Before that, websites needed to use external plugins such as Adobe Flash to display audio or video content on website. Adobe Flash, known as Macromedia Flash until 2005, was perhaps the most popular plug-in, to the point where it came pre-installed in some Windows computers. However, it was riddled with security problems and often did not cooperate with HTML and CSS elements. Hence, the native HTML5 audio player was created. Steve Job's 2010 rejection of Adobe Flash support, as well as YouTube's move to an HTML5 web player that same year, played a large role in the demise of Flash. Web developers were now turning away from Flash in order to have their applications more usable. Adobe Flash support is scheduled to end in 2020, thus making the audio element the way of the future.
    </p>

    
<h2>Syntax and Attributes</h2>
    
<p>Here is some example code with the &#60;audio&#62; element:</p>
    
<code>
    &#60;audio controls&#62;
  &#60;source src="flexidrum.wav" type="audio/wav" autoplay="true" loop="true"&#62;
Your browser does not support the HTML5 audio element. Here is a &#60;a href="flexidrum.wav"&#62;link to the audio&#60;/a&#62; instead.
&#60;/audio&#62;
</code>
    
<br>

<h3>Attributes</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>controls:</dt> <dd>This uses the browser's default audio control interface. You can also build your own interface using JavaScript. Minimum requirements for custom controls are the ability to start, stop, and adjust the volume.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>src:</dt> <dd>The source attribute contains a path to the audio you wish to embed.</dd>
        <dt>type:</dt> <dd>descrives the file format</dd> 
        <br>
        <dt>fallback content:</dt> <dd>The paragraph inside the audio tags will display if the browser is older and cannot display the &#60;audio&#62; element.</dd>
    
    </dl>


<h2>Basic Audio Formats</h2>
    <p>According to W3 Schools, the 3 supported audio formats in HTML5 are MP3, WAV, and OGG.</p>
<dl>
<dt>.MP3</dt><dd>MP3 is the best-known compressed file format. However, it is a liscenced format which requires its distributors to pay 2% of all revenue over $100k. Also, game creators need to pay a licence fee if they distribute over 5,000 copies. (cite: construct.net article. May want better source.) </dd>
<dt>.WAV</dt><dd> WAV is an uncompressed media type. The files are often very large and can have long loading times.</dd>
<dt>.OGG</dt><dd>Ogg is similar to MP3 but does not have any patents or required royalty fees. However, it is not currently supported on Internet Explorer or Safari. </dd>

</dl>
    
<h2> Sample Audio </h2>
<p>This audio player uses the default settings from your browser:</p>
<audio controls>
  <source src="flexidrum.wav" type="audio/wav" loop="true">
Your browser does not support the HTML5 audio element. Here is a <a href="flexidrum.wav">link to the audio</a> instead.
</audio>

<h2>Analysis and Conclusions</h2>
<p>Is the audio element an improvement on past technologies? This depends on the context. Digital audio players offer a great deal of convienience to people using devices with internet access such as laptops, tablets, and phones. When the content is downloaded, it can be played from anywhere with enough battery power. However, the audio tag itself involves streaming content from online; therefore, it's only viable if you have an internet connection. Written music is still the standard for much of music education &#40;cite?&#41; since it provides necessary information without the distractions inherent in a device connected to the internet. In addition, older media formats such as CD-ROMs may be more convienient when riding in older cars. While digital music is currently the most common format in the modern world, it is not a simple replacement for older formats-- rather, they are used alongside each other in different contexts.</p>
