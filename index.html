<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
New technologies did not come to exist in a vacuum; they instead come from a lineage of many technologies from the past. Haas (1999) speaks of the importance of complicating existing, overly simplistic ideas that people have about technological progress. One common idea is that of <i>simple replacement</i>, “which assumes that old and new technologies are clearly differentiated from each other, both theoretically and in practice, and that new technologies simply replace older, obsolete technologies” (p.210). However, many technologies complement each other and can even be used alongside each other. This is true with music-- for example, the use of CDs in a car, writen music books in front of a piano, and MP3s on a laptop. The second simplistic idea is that of <i>straightforward progress</i>, which is the idea that new technologies are inherently better than old technologies. While improvements can be made, it is important to think critically about these changes. Sometimes, when you gain something, you lose something else. </p>
    
<h2>Digital Sound Before HTML</h2>
    <p> Sound has been written since the first known instance of written music notes in <i>year</i>. The first instrument able to record and reproduce sound was Thomas Edison's phonograph in 1877. The user would speak into a mouthpiece, the sound of which vibrated a stylus accross a moving span of tinfoil to create a crude recording. This was improved with gramophone records, then ..., cassette tapes, CD-ROMS, and eventually digital sound via the MP3 player. &#40;Beardsley & Leetch-Wilkinson&#41;. &#40;more detail needed&#41;</p>
    

    
<h2>The History of &#60;audio&#62; Element</h2>
<p> HTML stands for <u>H</u>yper<u>T</u>ext <u>M</u>arkup <u>L</u>anguage, which a common programming language for the creation of websites. HTML uses elements, which are sometimes referred to as tags, in order to describe and style content on a web page. This website will focus on the history of the &#60;audio&#62; element, which is used to add audio content to websites.  </p>
<p> The &#60;audio&#62; element was added in HTML5. Before that, websites needed to use plugins such as Flash and Silverlight to display audio or video content on websites. However, these had problems with security and did not always work well with HTML and CSS elements. Therefore, the native HTML audio element was added in HTML5 to overcome these issues &#40;cite Mozilla website&#41;.</p>

    
<h2>Syntax and Attributes</h2>
    
<p>Here is some example code with the &#60;audio&#62; element:</p>
    
<code>
    &#60;audio controls&#62;
  &#60;source src="flexidrum.wav" type="audio/wav" autoplay="true" loop="true"&#62;
Your browser does not support the HTML5 audio element. Here is a &#60;a href="flexidrum.wav"&#62;link to the audio&#60;/a&#62; instead.
&#60;/audio&#62;
</code>
    
<br>

<h3>Attributes</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>controls:</dt> <dd>This uses the browser's default audio control interface. You can also build your own interface using JavaScript. Minimum requirements for custom controls are the ability to start, stop, and adjust the volume.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>src:</dt> <dd>The source attribute contains a path to the audio you wish to embed.</dd>
        <dt>type:</dt> <dd>descrives the file format</dd> 
        <br>
        <dt>fallback content:</dt> <dd>The paragraph inside the audio tags will display if the browser is older and cannot display the &#60;audio&#62; element.</dd>
    
    </dl>


<h2>Basic Audio Formats</h2>
    <p>According to W3 Schools, the 3 supported audio formats in HTML5 are MP3, WAV, and OGG.</p>
<dl>
<dt>.MP3</dt><dd>MP3 is the best-known compressed file format. However, it is a liscenced format which requires its distributors to pay 2% of all revenue over $100k. Also, game creators need to pay a licence fee if they distribute over 5,000 copies. (cite: construct.net article. May want better source.) </dd>
<dt>.WAV</dt><dd> WAV is an uncompressed media type. The files are often very large and can have long loading times.</dd>
<dt>.OGG</dt><dd>Ogg is similar to MP3 but does not have any patents or required royalty fees. However, it is not currently supported on Internet Explorer or Safari. </dd>

</dl>
    
<h2> Sample Audio </h2>
<p>This audio player uses the default settings from your browser:</p>
<audio controls>
  <source src="flexidrum.wav" type="audio/wav" loop="true">
Your browser does not support the HTML5 audio element. Here is a <a href="flexidrum.wav">link to the audio</a> instead.
</audio>

<h2>Analysis and Conclusions</h2>
<p>Is the audio element an improvement on past technologies? This depends on the context. Digital audio players offer a great deal of convienience to people using devices with internet access such as laptops, tablets, and phones. When the content is downloaded, it can be played from anywhere with enough battery power. However, the audio tag itself involves streaming content from online; therefore, it's only viable if you have an internet connection. Written music is still the standard for much of music education &#40;cite?&#41; since it provides necessary information without the distractions inherent in a device connected to the internet. In addition, older media formats such as CD-ROMs may be more convienient when riding in older cars. While digital music is currently the most common format in the modern world, it is not a simple replacement for older formats-- rather, they are used alongside each other in different contexts.</p>
